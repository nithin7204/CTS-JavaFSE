Exercise 2: E-commerce Platform Search Function

Big O Notation Overview:
- Linear Search: Best O(1), Average O(n), Worst O(n)
- Binary Search: Best O(1), Average/Worst O(log n) â€” only on sorted data

This example demonstrates:
- A Product class with productId, productName, and category.
- Linear and Binary search algorithms implemented in SearchService.
- Testing both methods in Tester.java.

Binary search is more efficient for large, sorted datasets. Use indexing or search engines like Elasticsearch in real-world applications.
